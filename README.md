Use Gradle-Kotlin-DSL to write build file
=========================================

Use Kotlin to write `build.gradle.kts` instead of `build.gradle'.

But with `build.gradle.kts`, IDEA becomes quite slow, makes it inefficient.

I tried but gave up to use it as the first choice, until the performance becomes better.
